# Bible Citation Plugin for Joplin

This plugin parses bible citation into bible verses. To do this you create a fenced block with "bible" as identifier with the following format:

    ```bible
    (John 3:16-17,18)
    (Psalms 1:1, 16:1-2)
    (Genesis 1 - Exodus 40)
    ```

For example:

The plugin is based on [Bible Passage Reference Parser](https://github.com/openbibleinfo/Bible-Passage-Reference-Parser) to parse the references.

## Installation
1. Install the .jpl under Releases.
2. Download a bible from /bibles/OSIS to your computer, or use an already existing bible.
3. Copy the path of the OSIS xml bible and paste it on the plugin setting "Path to OSIS bible file".
4. Select your desired language.
5. Enjoy.

For the settings to take effect after you save them arter already created cites, you have to make a change on any of them.
 
 ## Notes
 If you have a bug or any issue, feel free to make an issue or to modify the plugin.
